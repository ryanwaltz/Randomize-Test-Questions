# Randomize-Test-Questions

This program serves to randomize tests and reformat some answer choices.

# Input

This program takes an input of a .txt document that can be downloaded from a Google Doc or Microsoft Word Document.

# Format

This program assumes that every question will start with "XX.", where XX represents the number. It also assumes that the number will go sequentially
from one to whatever the last number is.

Due to certain ways Google Docs converts some lists, answer choices formatted in Google Docs will be changed from "1. " to "a. " and so on.
