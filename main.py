These list of common answer choice formatting helps the program not accidentally format answer choices twice.
Any answer choices without them will have their own answer choice (a., etc) added on to them.
This is especially helpful since some formatting from Google Docs or Word documents doesn't carry over to text documents.
This allows the user to have their choices formatted automatically instead of going over them manually.
